                    Ensuring proper audio in today's interactive classroom is ever more important with increasing investments in technologies like microphones, digital whiteboards, and projectors. Poor or incorrect audio from multimedia and voice amplification systems is not only counter-productive to education technology investments but is also a hindrance to the natural student learning taking place in the classroom.

                        <p>Often referred to as the "Holy Grail" of audio, authentic voice reproduction comes at a very high price in audio design. The Centré Fusion technique, partially visible by its acoustic fins, allows us to design audiophile-quality speakers of any size, shape, and power range. Now included in the newly redesigned Astronaut CL and XL speaker systems, Centré Fusion brings an all-new level of speech intelligibility to your audience.</p>

                    <h2>An Innovative Approach to Classroom Audio</h2>
                    <p>
                      The success of the Astronaut stems from its core audio technology that delivers 360° omni-directional sound for even frequency balance across the room. Patented worldwide, one Astronaut system replaces the equivalent of up to 6 in-ceiling speakers, delivering the benefits of less hardware, less energy usage, and simplified installation.

                          <li class="list-item-margin"><span>A Single Sweet Spot</span>Unlike in-ceiling or other directional speakers, the Astronaut creates a single sweet spot that covers the room, providing distortion-free listening no matter where you sit.</li>
